TRILLESKA / UTILS

The Trilleska software suite is a poor imitation of GNU coreutils and should be taken just as (if not more) seriously. We write simple code here, simple enough that even Maxi could understand it. A program that reads the contents of a file shouldn't be hundreds of lines long if it doesn't need to be.
